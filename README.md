# Trajectory Control for an Autonomous Vehicle Using NMPC and Vehicle Dynamics

## Overview
This project implements **trajectory control** for an autonomous vehicle using a **Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)** approach. The MATLAB function designed here incorporates detailed vehicle dynamics and a state-space model for controlling the vehicle's trajectory. The system outputs acceleration/deceleration commands and yaw angle, which are essential for guiding the vehicle along the desired trajectory while maintaining stability and safety.

## Key Features
- **Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)** for trajectory planning.
- Detailed vehicle dynamics modeled, including lateral and longitudinal behavior.
- State-space model representation for efficient and robust control.
- Outputs include acceleration, deceleration, and yaw angle commands.
- Flexible to handle varying vehicle speeds and trajectories.

## Files
- `trajectory_control.m`: The main function implementing NMPC, vehicle dynamics, and control.
- `vehicle_dynamics.m`: Function containing the detailed state-space model and equations representing vehicle dynamics.
- `nmpc_solver.m`: Custom NMPC solver to compute optimal control commands.
- `README.md`: This document, providing an overview of the code and instructions for use.

## Requirements
- **MATLAB** (R2021a or later recommended)
- **Control Systems Toolbox**
- **Optimization Toolbox** (for NMPC solver)
  
Make sure all required toolboxes are installed before running the code.

## System Model
The vehicle dynamics are modeled in a **state-space form** as follows:

\[
\dot{x} = f(x, u) \quad \text{(nonlinear state equation)}
\]

Where:
- **\(x\)** is the state vector, including vehicle position, velocity, yaw angle, and other relevant parameters.
- **\(u\)** is the control input vector, consisting of acceleration and steering (yaw angle).
  
The **control objective** is to track a desired trajectory by minimizing the deviation in position, heading, and velocity, while ensuring stability constraints are satisfied.

## NMPC Controller
The Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) solves the following optimization problem at each time step:
- **Cost Function**: Minimizes the error between the vehicle's actual state and the desired trajectory over a finite prediction horizon.
- **Constraints**:
  - **Input constraints**: Bounds on acceleration, deceleration, and yaw rate.
  - **State constraints**: Limits on vehicle dynamics such as speed, turning radius, and safety margins.

## Inputs and Outputs
### Inputs:
- **Initial State**: The initial state vector `[x, y, yaw, velocity]` of the vehicle.
- **Reference Trajectory**: A time series of desired vehicle positions and velocities.
- **Control Horizon**: Defines the prediction horizon for NMPC optimization.
- **Vehicle Parameters**: Parameters such as mass, inertia, tire stiffness, etc., that define the vehicle's dynamics.

### Outputs:
- **Acceleration Command**: The acceleration or deceleration (m/s²) required to follow the trajectory.
- **Yaw Angle Command**: The steering angle (degrees) to control the vehicle’s heading.

<! --## Usage
1. **Clone the repository** or download the code files.
2. In MATLAB, navigate to the directory containing the function files.
3. Run the `trajectory_control.m` function by providing the necessary inputs, such as the initial state and reference trajectory.

```matlab
% Example usage
initial_state = [0; 0; 0; 0];  % [x, y, yaw, velocity]
ref_trajectory = load('desired_trajectory.mat');  % Load trajectory data
vehicle_params = load('vehicle_params.mat');  % Load vehicle parameters

[accel_cmd, yaw_cmd] = trajectory_control(initial_state, ref_trajectory, vehicle_params); --!> 
```

4. The function returns the acceleration and yaw commands required to follow the given trajectory.

## Customization
- **Vehicle Parameters**: You can adjust the vehicle parameters in the `vehicle_dynamics.m` file to fit the specific characteristics of your autonomous vehicle (e.g., mass, tire stiffness, wheelbase).
- **Control Tuning**: The NMPC tuning parameters, such as cost function weights, control horizon, and constraints, can be adjusted in `nmpc_solver.m` to optimize the vehicle's performance for your use case.

## Visualization
The code includes basic visualization to plot the vehicle's path relative to the desired trajectory. You can modify or enhance the visualization for better understanding and debugging.

```matlab
plot_vehicle_trajectory(actual_states, ref_trajectory);
```

This function will plot the vehicle's movement, showing how closely it follows the desired path.

## Future Work
- **Integration with ROS**: The current implementation is in MATLAB but could be extended for real-time applications using ROS (Robot Operating System).
- **Extended Vehicle Models**: You can expand the current model to include more detailed aspects, such as tire dynamics, aerodynamics, and road friction variations.
- **Safety Features**: Add additional safety constraints such as collision avoidance or obstacle detection.
